<p>Enjoy cheaper electricity prices when wholesale prices fall!</p>

<p>With Agile Octopus, you get access to half-hourly energy prices, tied to wholesale prices and updated daily. So when wholesale electricity prices drop, so do your bills - and if you can shift your daily electricity use outside of peak times, you can save even more.</p>

<p>Agile Octopus is perfect for electric vehicles, storage heaters, or anyone who can shift their electricity use outside of peak times.</p>
